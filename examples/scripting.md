# Examples

I like to write bash scripts that have what I call a gui stop gap in it. What I call a gui stop gap is a cli command the opens up a gui for user input and then outputs to stdout. One such example is [dmenu-drag-and-drop](https://github.com/ZakharEl/dmenu-drag-and-drop/blob/5e412803c69328b46405d9ca792878f04cafc1c2/README.md), a file manager that can be used in shell scripts. I also wrote a script called mynetwork that uses dmenu prompts to connect to wifi. It ultimately uses the wpa_cli cli command under the hood. This is because I found network manager on linux uses python that in turn uses wpa_cli library. The python is so slow that it can bottleneck and drop internet connection even with strong wifi. So I cut out the middleman and used wpa_cli more directly in some bash scripts. No more python means no more bottlenecks and dropped connections. These networking shell scripts, however, are not on github, but they are available for hiring managers to see upon request. I have also wrote bash scripts to webscrape some of my online classes for backup and offline use. These certainly are not on github as I soley use these for educational purposes and don't trust others on the web to abuse these scripts for not so good uses.
