# Examples in Progress

I am currently in the middle of writing a OS and text editor agnostic snippet manager like those found in vscode, textmate and sublime text. It will be a universal daemon or background process written in rust. There will be different clients for each text editor but the communication protocol being used to communicate with daemon will be the same. So implementing a client for a given text editor should be trivial. It's just output request in the form of text within a given format and get text back as a response to and from the deamon. How the responses are handled will differ based on the client as the needs of the text editors they are designed for differ. This will allow snippets to be designed in the same format and with the same functionality accross all possible text editors and OSes. In addition I am writing libraries for this snippet manager in rust. I am implementing features and conditional compilation so people can control what functionality they want in their snippet manager. The libraries will also be divided so that functionality and parsing format could easily be reimplemented differently to easily build a different text editor and OS agnostic snippet manager daemon.
